ROB313 Assignment 2 - Generalized Linear Models
-----------------------------------------------

The program found in 'glm_main.py' contains the code that is used to acquire the results of question 1-3. The specific
functions for each question is sectioned off in the script, and need not be touched. 

To run the file, the only modifications that need to be made are to the main block. Each question has it's own section
it the 'if __name__ == "__main__":' block, and it clearly outlined with comments. To the run the code for a desired
question, simply uncomment the code for that section in the main block, and run. Required numeric results will be 
printed and required images will be save to the current directory.
